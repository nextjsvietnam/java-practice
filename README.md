VSCode itself doesn't come with built-in support for Java, so you'll need to install extensions. The easiest way to get all the necessary Java support is by installing the "Extension Pack for Java".

Open VSCode.
Go to the Extensions view by clicking on the square icon on the sidebar or pressing Ctrl+Shift+X.
Search for "Extension Pack for Java" by Microsoft.
Click Install on the extension pack. This pack includes:
Language Support for Java(TM) by Red Hat
Debugger for Java
Java Test Runner
Maven for Java
Java Dependency Viewer
Visual Studio IntelliCode
